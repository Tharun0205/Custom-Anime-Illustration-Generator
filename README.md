ðŸ§  ComfyUI Workflow Overview
This diagram illustrates a comprehensive ComfyUI pipeline for generating anime-style character illustrations from user-supplied sketches:

Checkpoint Loader uses a Stable Diffusion model (e.g., DreamShaper) as the foundation.

LoRA Loader applies a trained style adapter to infuse an anime aesthetic.

ControlNet (Canny/OpenPose) adds precise structural guidance based on the input sketchâ€™s outlines or pose landmarks.

Custom Python Node adjusts prompts dynamically, enabling flexible style and content variation.

KSampler performs denoising sampling to generate the final latent image.

Save Image outputs the high-quality PNG illustration.

By visually chaining these nodes, the workflow supports image-to-image processing, using both sketch input and style conditioningâ€”ideal for creating unique, customizable anime visuals.
